# SematicSegmentation
trying to build semantic segmentation models to classify cells or to segmentate outdoors objects. This repository will include many mini projects.

autonomous_drive.py --> It is an ai model training to segmentate outdoors objects. U-net architecture is build in the code. Cityspaces dataset is being used https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/ .Download gtFine_trainvaltest.zip (241MB) [md5] and leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip (11GB) [md5] are used in this project. There are many comments in the code to make it easier to understand.
