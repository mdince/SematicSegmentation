# SematicSegmentation
trying to build semantic segmentation models to classify cells or to segmentate outdoors objects. This repository will include many mini projects.

autonomous_drive.py --> It is an ai model training to segmentate outdoors objects. U-net architecture is build in the code. Cityspaces dataset is being used https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/ .Download gtFine_trainvaltest.zip (241MB) [md5] and leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip (11GB) [md5] are used in this project. There are many comments in the code to make it easier to understand. Change folder paths in code as to your liking. 

nuclei_ss.py --> It is an ai model for segmenting nuclei. U-net architecture is build in the code. 2018 - Data Science Bowl is being used https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-science-bowl-2018/data . Folders stage1_test and stage1_train has been used. This project was made with the help of youtube video series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azM57JuQpQI&t=1s. Change folder folder paths in code as to your liking.
